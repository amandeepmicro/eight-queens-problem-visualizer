# âš¡ The 8 Queens Problem Visualizer

ðŸ‘‘ Given a n X n chessboard. The task is to place n queens on the board, such that no two queens attack each other. We need to find distinct possible solutions for this problem.

ðŸ‘‘ By using "backtracking" - an algorithmus or set of clear defined instructions we can find all solutions systematically.

ðŸ‘‘ Itâ€™s a great little puzzle because itâ€™s not too hard to solve manually, and itâ€™s a fun programming exercise to write code to enumerate all the solutions.

Try yourself !
ðŸ‘‘ You can select the type of chess piece you want to play with :- ( â™• Queen, â™— Bishop, â™– Rock, â™˜ Knight ).

ðŸ‘‘ You can select manual mode or simulation mode.

ðŸ‘‘ You can select simulation speed and board size also.

ðŸ‘‘ By clicking the any solution in the solutions list the board will reset to represent the solution visually.

ðŸ‘‘ Select the manual mode to and try to find as many possible solutions that are distinct.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
